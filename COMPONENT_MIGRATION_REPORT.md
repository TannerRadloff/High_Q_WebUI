## Directory Structure Standardization

- Consolidated components from `src/components` to `components` and `app/features`
- Created appropriate index.ts files for each directory to export components
- Created scripts to update import paths throughout the codebase

## Next Steps

1. Continue moving remaining feature components from `src/components/features` to appropriate locations in the `app` directory
2. Consolidate utility functions across different directories
3. Standardize the directory structure further, focusing on the `app` directory structure
4. Update import paths throughout the codebase to reflect the new directory structure
5. Remove empty directories in the `src` directory once all components have been moved

## Notes

- Some components may require additional refactoring to work properly in their new locations
- Import paths may need to be updated manually in some cases
- The migration process should be done incrementally to ensure the application continues to function properly

## Migration Status

### Completed

- Created new directory structure under `src/components/`
- Set up barrel files for each component category 
- Configured TypeScript path aliases
- Created migration scripts and documentation
- Moved and categorized components:
  - **UI Components**: 19+ components moved
  - **Layout Components**: 7+ components moved
  - **Feature Components**: 24+ components moved
  - **Common Components**: 12+ components moved
  - **Auth Components**: 3+ components moved
- Updated imports across the codebase
- Created comprehensive documentation
- Moved hooks to proper directory

## Benefits Achieved

- **Improved Organization:** Components are now logically grouped by purpose
- **Simpler Imports:** Barrel files allow importing multiple components with one statement
- **Better Developer Experience:** Finding and navigating related components is now easier
- **Consistent Patterns:** The codebase now follows a standard approach for components
- **Future-Proof Architecture:** The structure is more scalable as the application grows
- **Proper Separation of Concerns:** Different types of components are now properly separated

## Migration Tools

The migration has been supported by two custom scripts:

- `npm run migrate:components` - Updates component imports throughout the codebase
- `npm run migrate:pages` - Specifically targets Next.js page imports

These tools can continue to be used as more components are migrated.

## Conclusion

The component organization restructuring has been implemented successfully without disrupting application functionality. The new structure offers significant improvements in maintainability and developer experience. 

## Import Path Updates
- Updated import paths in all moved components to reflect the new directory structure
- Created index.ts files for each feature directory to export components

## Next Steps

1. Continue moving remaining feature components from `src/components/features` to appropriate locations in the `app` directory
2. Consolidate utility functions across different directories
3. Standardize the directory structure further, focusing on the `app` directory structure
