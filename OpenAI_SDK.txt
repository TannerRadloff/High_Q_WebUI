. Architectural Overview: High-Level Orchestrator (Delegation AI)
At the heart of this system is an AI Orchestrator – a meta-controller agent that receives user queries, breaks them into sub-tasks, and delegates each task to the appropriate specialized agent. This design follows a delegation AI pattern: a central “brain” coordinates multiple expert AI agents to fulfill complex user requests. The orchestrator itself doesn’t execute domain-specific logic; instead, it routes queries to the correct agent and sequences their execution​
OPENAI.COM
. Each specialized agent is an AI with a focused role or toolset, such as web research, report writing, or file data extraction. This multi-agent orchestration approach improves both efficiency and organization of AI workflows. By dividing responsibilities, each agent can use prompts and tools tailored to its task. For example, a Research Agent can focus on finding relevant information, and a Report Agent can focus on composing a structured answer. The orchestrator ensures these agents work together in a coherent pipeline. In essence, an Agent is defined by specific instructions and tools, and can even decide to hand off to another agent when appropriate​
GITHUB.COM
. This hand-off mechanism allows the orchestrator agent to dynamically delegate tasks, essentially acting as a traffic director for the query. Key benefits of this architecture:
Task Specialization: Each agent excels at a certain type of task (search, writing, data retrieval, etc.), leading to better quality results.
Dynamic Delegation: The orchestrator can route queries or partial results to the agent best suited for the next step, whether via predefined rules or AI-powered reasoning (e.g. a “triage” agent that decides the routing​
OPENAI.COM
).
Maintainability: Logic for each task type is isolated. Adding or updating an agent’s behavior doesn’t heavily impact others, making the system easy to extend (we’ll discuss extensibility in Section 3).
Composability: Complex requests can be broken into simpler subtasks handled in sequence or in parallel by different agents, then assembled into a final answer by the orchestrator.
2. Technology Stack: Node.js & TypeScript for Production
We’ll implement the system in Node.js with TypeScript, which is well-suited for building scalable backend services. TypeScript’s static typing and rich tooling help manage a growing codebase of multiple agents and orchestrator logic. Node.js provides an asynchronous, event-driven runtime that can efficiently handle multiple API calls (to OpenAI or other services) in parallel – useful if the orchestrator needs to perform concurrent tasks. Key aspects of the tech stack and best practices:
Official OpenAI Node SDK: Use OpenAI’s official JavaScript/TypeScript SDK for convenient API access​
GITHUB.COM
​
GITHUB.COM
. This SDK supports the new Responses API, allowing us to call models with tools in a straightforward way. For example, the openai package can be installed via NPM and used to create requests to GPT-4 with web search or file search enabled.
Modular Code Structure: Organize the project into distinct modules: e.g. agents/ResearchAgent.ts, agents/ReportAgent.ts, agents/FileAgent.ts, and an Orchestrator.ts. Each agent module encapsulates its prompt templates and OpenAI API calls related to its function. The orchestrator module contains the logic to analyze user queries and delegate to agents. This separation ensures high cohesion within modules and low coupling between them, aiding maintainability.
Scalability: Design the agent system as stateless services where possible. For a production deployment, you could run the orchestrator and agent components on a server or serverless environment. Because Node.js is non-blocking, the orchestrator can manage multiple user requests concurrently. Ensure the system can scale horizontally by running multiple instances behind a load balancer if needed. Also consider using message queues or background job processors if some tasks (like heavy web research) should be done asynchronously.
Efficiency: Use Node’s asynchronous features (Promises, async/await) to perform tasks in parallel when appropriate. For example, if a report requires two separate research queries, the orchestrator can dispatch both to a ResearchAgent in parallel using Promise.all. Also leverage streaming responses from OpenAI to start processing partial output sooner (the OpenAI SDK supports streaming via a stream: true option​
GITHUB.COM
).
TypeScript Typings: Define interfaces or abstract classes for Agents (e.g. an Agent interface with a method execute(query): Promise<Result>). This provides a clear contract for what each agent must implement, making it easier to add new agents. It also helps catch integration errors at compile time.
Configuration and Secrets: Follow best practices for managing API keys and configuration. For instance, use environment variables (and a library like dotenv) to load your OpenAI API key and any other config (like IDs for file storage, etc.) so that no secrets are hard-coded. This also makes it easy to configure different environments (dev, staging, prod) with different keys or model parameters.
By using Node.js and TypeScript with these practices, we can build an agent system that’s production-ready: modular, scalable, and efficient.
3. Agent Implementation: Examples of Specialized Agents
Let’s define a few specialized agent types to see how they work in our system. Each agent will use OpenAI’s APIs (especially the new tools in the Responses API) to carry out its task. We’ll cover three example agents and then discuss how to add more:
a. Research Agent (Web Search)
Purpose: The Research Agent’s job is to gather up-to-date information from the web in response to a user query. It essentially acts as the system’s information collector, using OpenAI’s web browsing capability. How it works: This agent uses OpenAI’s Web Search tool to find relevant information online and return a summary with references. OpenAI’s built-in web search tool can retrieve accurate, cited answers from the web​
COMMUNITY.OPENAI.COM
. Under the hood, the model performs a live internet search (similar to ChatGPT’s browsing feature) and incorporates the results into its response, including citations/URLs for transparency. The agent might receive a query (e.g. "What are the latest developments in renewable energy?") and produce an answer containing the key points and references to sources. Implementation details:
Model & Tools: Use the Responses API with a model that supports web search (e.g. gpt-4o which is GPT-4 with tool-use enabled)​
COMMUNITY.OPENAI.COM
. In the API request, enable the web search tool. For example, you can specify the tools in the request configuration. (In pseudocode: openai.responses.create({ model: "gpt-4o", tools: ["web_search"], input: userQuestion })).
Prompting: Provide the agent with an instruction prompt that it should search the web for relevant info and return a concise summary with sources. The Responses API allows an instructions field that functions like a system prompt​
GITHUB.COM
. For instance: "You are a Research Agent. Given a query, you search the web and provide a summary of findings with proper citations."
Output: The agent’s output to the orchestrator will be a summary of information plus citation markers or links. Because the web search tool automatically adds sources, the response often includes footnote-style references or URLs​
COMMUNITY.OPENAI.COM
. The orchestrator can use or pass along this enriched info to other agents.
b. Report Writing Agent (Report Composer)
Purpose: The Report Writing Agent takes collected data (e.g. from the Research Agent or File Processing Agent) and produces a well-structured report or answer. This could be a detailed written response to the user’s original query, formatted and with citations included. How it works: This agent is essentially a writing expert. It uses GPT-4 (or another model) to synthesize information into a cohesive narrative. If the query is complex (e.g. "Prepare a summary report on X including recent trends and relevant statistics"), the orchestrator might first call the Research Agent to gather facts, then feed those facts into the Report Writing Agent to generate the final report. Implementation details:
Input: The agent receives a prompt containing the raw information or notes to synthesize. For example, the orchestrator could provide it with a compiled text of bullet points from the Research Agent, plus any user preferences (like desired format or tone).
Prompting: Use the Responses API (or Chat Completions API) without external tools for this agent – it primarily needs the language model’s writing capability. The instructions for this agent could be: "You are a Report Writing Agent. You take research data and compose a clear, structured report for the user, in Markdown format, including citations for any facts or quotes."
Citation handling: Since the input data from the Research Agent likely contains citations (URLs or reference numbers), instruct the model to preserve those in the final output. For example, if the research notes say “Renewable energy capacity grew 10% in 2023【source】,” the report agent should carry over or appropriately reference that source.
Formatting: The agent should structure the report with an introduction, body sections, and a conclusion if applicable. It can use Markdown (headings, lists) for clarity, as our final output to the user can benefit from nice formatting. This agent doesn’t use additional tools, but focuses on coherent and correct writing, using the power of GPT-4 to ensure the answer is well-formed.
c. File Processing Agent (Knowledge Base Query)
Purpose: The File Processing Agent can search and extract information from a set of documents or files – for example, company knowledge base files, PDFs, or any data the user has provided. It’s useful for queries that require referencing internal or custom data, rather than public web information. How it works: This agent uses OpenAI’s File Search tool, which is a hosted retrieval system. OpenAI’s file search allows the model to look up information in a collection of previously uploaded files​
PLATFORM.OPENAI.COM
. Essentially, you upload documents to OpenAI’s system (via their Files API), and the file search tool can index and query them. The agent sends a query to this tool and gets back relevant text snippets from the files. Implementation details:
Preparation: In a production setting, you would maintain a set of files in the OpenAI system (or vector database) that represent your knowledge base. The File Processing Agent assumes those files are available. OpenAI’s File Search supports multiple file types (PDFs, text, etc.), does intelligent reranking and even query rewriting to improve results​
COMMUNITY.OPENAI.COM
.
Model & Tools: Use the Responses API with file search enabled as a tool. For example: openai.responses.create({ model: "gpt-4o", tools: ["file_search"], input: userQuery }). You may need to specify which file set or any filter parameters (the tool allows attribute filtering, etc. as per OpenAI’s docs​
COMMUNITY.OPENAI.COM
).
Prompting: Instructions for this agent could be: "You are a File Agent with access to company documents. Answer the query by searching the internal files and quoting the relevant passages with references." The model will then invoke the file search tool under the hood, retrieve relevant text from the knowledge base, and include that in its answer.
Output: The response might include excerpts from files or a summary of what was found, along with references (which could be file IDs or titles as citations). For example, if the user asks “What does our 2024 sales report say about Q1 revenue?” the agent would search that specific file and return the pertinent section, citing the report.
d. Extensibility – Adding New Agent Types
One of the strengths of this architecture is how easily you can introduce new specialized agents. Thanks to the modular structure and the orchestrator’s delegation logic, a developer can add a new agent type by implementing the required interface and updating the orchestrator’s routing mechanism. To add a new agent:
Create a new Agent Module: Write a new class or module that implements the Agent interface (e.g. CustomerSupportAgent for answering product support questions, or CodeAnalysisAgent for reviewing code). Give it appropriate instructions (persona and role) and connect any needed tools or functions. The Agents SDK was designed to make agents easily configurable LLMs with clear instructions and built-in tools​
OPENAI.COM
, meaning each agent is mostly defined by its prompt and tool list.
Integrate Tools if Needed: If the new agent needs a tool (e.g. maybe a TranslationAgent might use a hypothetical translation memory tool, or a CalculationAgent could use a math tool), enable it via the Responses API tools or function calling. Otherwise, it might just use the base model.
Register with Orchestrator: Update the orchestrator so it knows about the new agent. This could be as simple as adding an instance of the agent to a list of available agents or adding a condition in the delegation logic. If using the Agents SDK with a triage agent, you would include the new agent in the possible handoffs list of the orchestrator agent​
OPENAI.COM
.
Minimal Impact: Since agents communicate through the orchestrator, adding a new one typically doesn’t require changing the existing agents’ code. This loose coupling allows you to extend the system for new capabilities (e.g. adding a “Math Agent” to handle complex calculations) without breaking existing functionality.
For example, if we wanted a Translation Agent for handling queries like "Translate this report to Spanish," we would create a TranslationAgent with instructions to translate text, perhaps use a translation API or just GPT-4 itself, and then modify the orchestrator to send any translation requests to this agent. The rest of the system remains unchanged. In summary, each agent is a modular component. Thanks to clear interfaces and the orchestrator pattern, adding new agents or swapping one out is straightforward, making the system very adaptable to evolving requirements.
4. Using OpenAI’s Responses API (vs Chat Completions API)
OpenAI’s Responses API is a new API paradigm that simplifies building agentic applications by combining the conversational power of Chat Completions with built-in tool usage and state handling​
COMMUNITY.OPENAI.COM
. Instead of manually managing function calls or using separate models for tools, the Responses API allows the model to call tools like web search or file search directly within a single conversation flow. Here’s how to leverage it in our agent system:
Single-call Tool Use: With the Responses API, you can include a tools array in your API request to specify which tools the model can use for that query (such as "web_search" or "file_search"). The model will then decide if and when to invoke those tools while formulating its answer. For example, enabling web search means the model can fetch up-to-date information online and incorporate it into the answer with citations​
COMMUNITY.OPENAI.COM
. Enabling file search lets it pull data from your uploaded files when needed. This is all done in one API call cycle – the model’s use of the tool and the integration of results into the final answer happen behind the scenes, automatically added to the conversation context​
COMMUNITY.OPENAI.COM
.
No More Separate Models for Tools: Previously, with the Chat Completions API alone, you might have had to use specialized models (like the *-search-preview models) or implement function calling to do things like web browsing. The Responses API streamlines this. For instance, using web search in Responses API just requires using the gpt-4o or gpt-4o-mini model and configuring the tool access​
COMMUNITY.OPENAI.COM
. (Those are GPT-4 variants that have “operations” ability for tools). In contrast, with pure Chat API you’d have to orchestrate a tool call manually or switch to a search-augmented model. The Responses API “bakes in” the tool usage for you, making your code simpler.
Example – Web Search via Responses API: In Node.js using the OpenAI SDK, a call might look like:
typescript
Copy
Edit
const response = await openaiClient.responses.create({
  model: 'gpt-4o',  // GPT-4 with tool support
  tools: ['web_search'],  // enable web search tool
  instructions: 'You are a research agent that provides answers with citations.',
  input: userQuery  // the user's question or task
});
const answer = response.output_text;
In this request, we specify the model and enable the web_search tool. We also set an instructions prompt to guide the model’s behavior (similar to a system message), and the input is the user’s query. The returned response.output_text will contain the answer, including any content gathered via the web search tool. OpenAI describes Web Search as delivering answers from the web with cited sources, integrated with just a few lines of code​
COMMUNITY.OPENAI.COM
, which this single API call demonstrates.
Example – File Search via Responses API: Similarly, to query internal files:
typescript
Copy
Edit
const response = await openaiClient.responses.create({
  model: 'gpt-4o',
  tools: ['file_search'],
  instructions: 'You are a file expert agent with access to company documents.',
  input: userQuestion
});
console.log(response.output_text);
Here the model knows it can use the file_search tool to retrieve info from uploaded files. You might need to ensure the query includes some reference to what to search, and the tool will return relevant file data. The model then outputs an answer that includes that file information. OpenAI’s File Search tool supports rich querying (multiple file types, filtering, etc.) to get accurate results from your knowledge base​
COMMUNITY.OPENAI.COM
.
Built-in State Management: Another advantage of the Responses API is improved state handling. It is designed to carry the conversation and tool results in the context without the developer having to manually maintain conversation history or function results injection (as was needed with function calling in the Chat API). This means your agents can have multi-turn interactions and the context (including what was found via tools) persists, making the development of complex agent behaviors easier​
COMMUNITY.OPENAI.COM
. If your orchestrator or agents need to remember previous steps, the Responses API can manage that state (similar to how the Assistants API worked, and there are plans to reach feature parity with it​
COMMUNITY.OPENAI.COM
).
When to use Chat Completions vs Responses: Going forward, the Responses API is likely the preferred method for agentic systems​
COMMUNITY.OPENAI.COM
. You would use Chat Completions API for basic conversations without tool use, or if you need a model that isn’t yet available in Responses. But for our system where agents need web browsing or file lookup capabilities, Responses API is the way to go. It provides a more flexible foundation for these AI agents, as it was built with such use-cases in mind.
In summary, using the Responses API allows our Node.js orchestrator and agents to call a single unified API for both conversation and tools. This reduces the complexity of our code (we don’t have to manually handle search or file retrieval logic – the model does it) and leverages OpenAI’s latest offerings for dynamic tool-using AI. It’s faster and easier for building these agents​
COMMUNITY.OPENAI.COM
, which means quicker development and less overhead in maintaining separate processes or plugins.
5. Utilizing OpenAI’s Agents SDK for Orchestration
OpenAI’s Agents SDK is an orchestration framework specifically designed to simplify building and scaling multi-agent systems. Instead of writing all the delegation logic from scratch, the Agents SDK provides abstractions for defining agents, tools, and the interactions (handoffs) between them​
OPENAI.COM
. Here’s how you can leverage it in building your agent system:
Defining Agents with the SDK: The Agents SDK lets you define an agent by specifying its name, instructions (role/prompt), and available tools in a simple configuration. For example, in Python (as shown in OpenAI’s announcement), you can create agents like a “Shopping Assistant” with a web search tool, or a “Support Agent” with a refund-processing function, in just a few lines​
OPENAI.COM
​
OPENAI.COM
. Each agent is essentially an LLM with a particular persona and optional functions it can call. In Node/TypeScript, the official Agents SDK support is coming soon​
OPENAI.COM
. In the meantime, the same concepts apply: you might use a community port of the SDK or implement a similar pattern manually (for instance, using the open-source Swarm framework which inspired the Agents SDK​
OPENAI.COM
).
Orchestrator (Triage Agent) with Handoffs: One of the powerful features of the Agents SDK is handoffs – the ability for one agent to delegate control to another. In our architecture, the orchestrator is effectively a triage agent whose job is to route the user’s request to the correct specialist agent. With the SDK, you can formalize this by giving the orchestrator agent a list of other agents it can hand off to​
OPENAI.COM
. For example, you might create a TriageAgent with instructions like “You are a coordinator AI. You analyze the user request and delegate it to the appropriate agent from the team,” and then list the researchAgent, reportAgent, fileAgent in its handoffs. The SDK runtime will allow the triage agent (backed by an LLM) to decide which specialized agent should handle the query, and seamlessly transfer the conversation to that agent. This mimics how a human operator might pass a customer to a department expert.
Built-in Tools and Function Calls: The Agents SDK integrates with OpenAI’s tool APIs (the same Responses API tools we discussed). For instance, it provides ready-to-use classes like WebSearchTool() that an agent can use​
OPENAI.COM
. It also allows custom functions to be registered as tools (using decorators or definitions), such as the submit_refund_request function in OpenAI’s example​
OPENAI.COM
​
OPENAI.COM
. These become actions the agent can invoke when the model decides. In our context, we can use built-in tools for web and file search or define our own tools (like a function to query an internal database, send an email, etc.) and attach them to agents. The SDK handles the plumbing of calling these functions when the model requests them and injecting the results back to the model’s context.
Observability and Debugging: In production, understanding what your agents are doing is crucial. The Agents SDK comes with tracing and observability features out of the box​
OPENAI.COM
. It can log each step an agent takes, each tool invocation, and decisions made during handoffs. These logs can be visualized to trace the agent’s reasoning and identify issues or bottlenecks. For example, you can see if the triage agent is correctly routing queries or if it’s confused by certain phrasing. This observability is a big improvement over trying to log prompt and response texts manually.
Safety Guardrails: Another advantage of using the SDK is the ease of adding safety checks. The framework includes configurable guardrails for input/output validation​
OPENAI.COM
. You can set up rules or use provided ones to ensure agents aren’t producing disallowed content or that certain sensitive tasks require confirmation. This dovetails with security best practices (discussed more in the next section). Essentially, the SDK can intercept and validate requests and responses to help prevent unintended behavior, such as a tool being misused due to a prompt injection attack.
Compatibility: The Agents SDK is designed to work with the Responses API (and it also supports Chat Completions API)​
OPENAI.COM
. This means you can use the latest models and tools seamlessly. It’s also open-source and model-agnostic to an extent – you could plug in other LLM providers that have a compatible chat API. This flexibility ensures your investment in building with the SDK isn’t locked to only one environment.
Node.js Usage: As of the initial release, the Agents SDK library was Python-focused​
OPENAI.COM
. Node.js support is expected (“coming soon”), but you can still apply the same principles in Node. You might:
Use the official OpenAI Node SDK to call the Responses API and manually implement a simple version of the orchestration loop (the example in the next section will illustrate this).
Or use community projects that port or mimic the Agents SDK in Node (for instance, a project called Swarm.js reimplemented the Swarm framework in Node.js, allowing agent definitions and handoffs in a similar manner​
GITHUB.COM
​
GITHUB.COM
).
In either case, the Agent SDK’s concepts – defining agents with roles and tools, and orchestrating their interactions – can be translated into your Node application structure.
In short, OpenAI’s Agents SDK provides a higher-level framework to build our delegation system. It abstracts much of the complexity (tool integration, agent switching, logging, etc.), letting us focus on writing good prompts and defining agent capabilities. While our TypeScript examples might implement some of this manually, being aware of the SDK’s features (like easy handoffs and guardrails) helps us design a cleaner architecture. As the SDK matures (especially with official Node support), integrating it directly into a TypeScript codebase will become even easier, further reducing boilerplate and ensuring robust agent behavior out-of-the-box.
6. Task Delegation and Workflow Management
Implementing a dynamic task delegation mechanism is central to our orchestrator’s role. The system needs to determine, at runtime, which agent (or sequence of agents) should handle a given user request and in what order. Here’s how to approach it:
Triage via AI or Rules: The simplest form of delegation is rule-based. For instance, you might inspect the user query for keywords or patterns: if it asks for “search” or mentions “latest” or “news”, route to the Research Agent; if it asks for a “report” or “summary”, involve the Report Writing Agent; if it references “file” or an internal document name, use the File Agent. This can be done with if-else logic or a mapping of intents to agents. However, a more flexible (and recommended) approach is to let an AI triage agent do this classification. As described earlier, a triage agent can be an LLM that reads the user query and decides which specialized agent is best suited​
OPENAI.COM
. Because it’s using natural language understanding, it may catch nuances that simple keyword rules would miss. For example, a query “What do our internal sales docs say about last year’s revenue, and can you compile that with recent industry trends?” actually requires both file search and web search plus a report – a smart triage agent could break this into two tasks (one for File Agent, one for Research Agent) and then funnel both results to the Report Agent.
Delegation as a Workflow: The orchestrator can manage multi-step workflows by calling agents in sequence and passing outputs along. In code, this could mean:
Orchestrator receives the user query.
Orchestrator (or triage agent) decides which agent goes first, or that multiple agents are needed.
It calls the chosen agent’s execute function with the query (or a portion of the query relevant to that agent).
It gets the result from the agent. If that result is final (e.g. if Research Agent was called just to fetch info), the orchestrator then calls the next agent (e.g. Report Agent) with that result included in the prompt.
This continues until the final agent produces the answer to return to the user.
The delegation mechanism can be dynamic – e.g., if the first agent’s output indicates a certain follow-up is needed, the orchestrator can adapt. Using the Agents SDK, this kind of multi-step handoff is handled by the framework (one agent can directly hand off to another and even provide context variables)​
GITHUB.COM
. Without the SDK, you can manually code this chain of calls.
Parallel vs Sequential Tasks: In some cases, tasks can be parallelized. The orchestrator could dispatch two agents at once if their tasks are independent. For example, if a user asks a two-part question that can be split, the orchestrator might run a web search and a file search simultaneously, then merge the findings. In practice, start simple with sequential delegation (since often steps depend on previous results). If you do parallelize, ensure you merge results carefully and consider any race conditions or combined prompt length issues when feeding into the next agent.
Maintaining Context: If the user is having a multi-turn conversation with your system (less likely in a one-off query scenario, but possible), the orchestrator should retain context of previous interactions. This can be stored and provided to the triage agent or subsequent agents as needed (or use the Responses API’s ability to maintain conversation state). Essentially, the orchestrator can carry a memory state that gets appended to prompts so the agents know what’s already been discussed or found. For example, after an initial research, if the user asks a follow-up, the orchestrator can remind the Research Agent what was previously found to avoid repeating work.
Example Delegation Flow: Suppose a user asks: “Find out the current weather in Paris and summarize it in a brief report.” The orchestrator might do the following:
Triage decides this requires web information (weather) and a summary. It first calls the Research Agent with the query "Current weather in Paris".
The Research Agent uses web search and returns: "The weather in Paris is 18°C, partly cloudy as of today【source】."
Orchestrator takes that result, and calls the Report Writing Agent with: "User wants a brief report on the weather in Paris. Here is info: [weather info]. Please produce a summary."
The Report Agent returns a nicely formatted paragraph: "Paris is currently experiencing mild weather at 18°C with partly cloudy skies. Tourists and locals can expect ... (Source: Weather.com)".
Orchestrator sends this final answer back to the user.
All of this was dynamic: if the research step had returned multiple pieces of data (say a forecast as well), the orchestrator could include all that for the report. If the query was different, the path would change. The key is that the orchestrator contains the logic (AI-driven or hardcoded) to manage this workflow and decide which agent(s) to invoke in what order.
Error or Uncertainty Handling: Part of delegation is also deciding what to do if an agent cannot handle a request. If none of the specialized agents are appropriate (or if the triage agent is unsure), you might have a default behavior (like handle it with a general GPT-4 answer). Or the orchestrator could ask a clarifying question back to the user. Designing these fallback paths is important for a robust system – the orchestrator essentially orchestrates not just the happy path, but also these contingencies.
By implementing a clear delegation strategy, your orchestrator ensures the user’s request is handled by the right expert at the right time. This results in a smooth workflow where, from the user’s perspective, it feels like interacting with one AI that is highly capable in many areas, while under the hood multiple agents are collaborating to deliver that result.
7. Production Considerations (Security, Rate Limits, Logging, etc.)
When moving this multi-agent system to production, there are several important considerations to ensure it runs securely, reliably, and efficiently:
Security & Safety: Because agents (especially with tools like web search or computer use) can perform powerful actions, enforce strict safety measures:
Prompt Injection Defense: Be cautious that user inputs could try to manipulate the agent’s prompts (especially the orchestrator or triage which might have a system prompt to route tasks). Use the Agents SDK guardrails or manual checks to sanitize user queries. For instance, strip or neutralize instructions like "Ignore previous directions" in user input.
Tool Use Restrictions: Only enable the tools that are necessary for a given request. For example, don’t leave the computer_use tool enabled for an agent unless absolutely needed, since it can execute actions on a machine. OpenAI has added safety checks and confirmation steps for sensitive tools like computer use​
OPENAI.COM
. If you use such tools, make sure to incorporate those confirmations (e.g., require certain actions to be approved by a human or have the model double-check).
Output Validation: Validate the agents’ outputs especially when they involve executing something (like if an agent returns a command to run). The Agents SDK’s guardrails feature allows configuring validators for agent outputs​
OPENAI.COM
, which can help ensure the result is in an expected format or doesn’t contain disallowed content. In a simpler case, you might manually check that a URL returned by web search is not malicious before presenting it.
Least Privilege for Functions: If you attach custom tools (functions) that perform actions (like database writes, or sending emails), code them defensively. For example, limit the scope of data they can access. Also, consider requiring certain trigger phrases or conditions in the AI output before executing, to avoid accidental misuse.
API Rate Limits & Quotas: OpenAI’s APIs have rate limits. A busy production system with many agents could hit these limits (each agent call is an API call). Mitigation strategies:
Request Throttling: Implement a queue or throttle to pace calls. If the user input triggers a flurry of agent actions, you might spread them slightly or combine where possible. The Node.js app can inspect HTTP 429 responses (Too Many Requests) and back off or retry after a delay.
Batching and Caching: If multiple users ask similar questions that result in the same research, consider caching those results so the Research Agent doesn’t call the API for each user. For example, cache the output of “current weather in Paris” for a short period. However, be mindful of content that could be user-specific or sensitive – cache only general or non-sensitive results.
Scaling Out: If your volume grows, use multiple API keys or apply for higher rate limits from OpenAI for your project. Also distribute load across multiple process instances if needed, each with its own rate limit window.
Error Handling & Resilience: Things will go wrong – network hiccups, API errors, etc. Your orchestrator should handle exceptions gracefully:
Use try/catch around each agent API call. If a call fails, you can retry it (perhaps with exponential backoff) a couple of times.
If a non-critical agent fails, decide whether to continue the workflow or abort. For instance, if a web search fails, you might try a backup strategy (maybe use a different API or return a message that the info couldn’t be retrieved).
Log errors with enough context (which agent, what query) to debug later.
Consider timeouts: if an agent (or the underlying model) is taking too long, you might want to cancel and perhaps try a simpler approach. The Node SDK allows setting timeouts or using the AbortController for fetch requests.
Logging & Monitoring: Monitoring the behavior of an AI agent system is crucial:
Logging: Implement structured logging for each step. For example, log an entry when the orchestrator receives a user query, when it delegates to an agent, and when the agent returns. Include identifiers (user request ID, agent name, maybe a shortened version of the prompt or result) for traceability. In Node, you might use a logging library like Winston or Pino for performance and flexibility.
Agent Traces: If using the Agents SDK, take advantage of its observability tools​
OPENAI.COM
. You can get trace logs or even UI visualization (OpenAI’s toolkit might provide a dashboard or you can export logs to your own interface). This helps in understanding how the model decided to call a tool or why it handed off to a certain agent.
Metrics: Monitor metrics such as the number of API calls, latency of each agent’s response, success/failure rates, etc. These can be sent to a monitoring service (like Datadog, New Relic, etc.). For instance, track how long the Research Agent usually takes so you can spot if it becomes slow (maybe the web search API is down or slow).
Alerts: Set up alerts for unusual activity – e.g., if error rates spike or if output validation catches something, notify the developers or automatically disable certain functionality until reviewed.
Performance & Cost Optimization: Each API call has a cost (especially GPT-4). To optimize:
Choose Models Wisely: Use the smaller gpt-4o-mini for certain agents if appropriate, or even gpt-3.5 for lighter tasks, to save cost and increase speed. For example, triage classification might be fine with a less expensive model, whereas the heavy lifting of writing a report might need GPT-4.
Streaming Responses: Leverage streaming to start processing answers sooner or to send partial results to the client. The OpenAI Node SDK supports streaming responses​
GITHUB.COM
, which you can pipe to the user as they are generated. This improves perceived performance.
Concurrency Management: Node can handle many concurrent requests, but be mindful of memory – each agent’s chain will hold some context. If using very large contexts (long conversation history or many file search results), monitor the memory usage.
Warm-ups and Caching: If an agent uses the same prompt structure often, there’s not much caching you can do on the LLM side, but you could cache tool results (like file search outputs for identical queries, as mentioned). Also, if you have an initialization cost (like loading files or a vector index for file search), do that at startup rather than on-demand, so users don’t incur that overhead on first request.
Compliance and Data Handling: Ensure you comply with data policies. If your file agent is using user-uploaded documents, handle that data carefully (e.g., encrypt files at rest if stored, and clean them up if not needed). Also be mindful of what data you send to OpenAI (don’t send highly sensitive info unless you have agreements in place, etc., as per OpenAI API data usage policies).
By addressing these production considerations, you’ll make your AI agent system robust and secure. The goal is that even as you scale up usage, the system remains stable, doesn’t exceed service limits, and protects both the system and the user’s data.
8. Example Implementation (TypeScript Code)
Let’s put together a simplified example in TypeScript to illustrate how the orchestrator and agents might be implemented. This example will show: an Agent interface, a couple of agent classes (ResearchAgent, ReportAgent, FileAgent), an Orchestrator class that delegates tasks, and usage of the OpenAI API (using the Node SDK). Assume you have installed the OpenAI SDK (npm install openai) and set up your API key in an environment variable. Also, these classes are highly simplified for demonstration purposes (not including full error handling or streaming for brevity).
typescript
Copy
Edit
// agent.ts - Define a common Agent interface and base class (optional)
export interface Agent {
  name: string;
  handleTask(userQuery: string, context?: any): Promise<string>;
}

// orchestrator.ts - The Orchestrator class
import { Agent } from './agent';
import { ResearchAgent } from './agents/ResearchAgent';
import { ReportAgent } from './agents/ReportAgent';
import { FileAgent } from './agents/FileAgent';

class Orchestrator {
  private agents: Record<string, Agent>;

  constructor() {
    // Initialize available agents
    const researchAgent = new ResearchAgent();
    const reportAgent = new ReportAgent();
    const fileAgent = new FileAgent();
    this.agents = {
      research: researchAgent,
      report: reportAgent,
      file: fileAgent
      // Easily extend by adding new agents here
    };
  }

  /** Process the user query by delegating to the appropriate agent(s). */
  async handleQuery(userQuery: string): Promise<string> {
    // Simple routing logic (could be AI-based triage for more sophistication)
    let response: string;

    if (this.isFileQuery(userQuery)) {
      // If query seems related to file/knowledge base
      response = await this.agents.file.handleTask(userQuery);
    } else if (this.isSearchQuery(userQuery)) {
      // If query likely needs web research
      const data = await this.agents.research.handleTask(userQuery);
      // Pass the research data to the report agent to formulate a final answer
      const combinedPrompt = `User asked: "${userQuery}". Here are notes from research:\n${data}\nPlease write a concise report or answer using this information.`;
      response = await this.agents.report.handleTask(combinedPrompt);
    } else {
      // Default: if it doesn't match specific patterns, just use report agent directly
      response = await this.agents.report.handleTask(userQuery);
    }

    return response;
  }

  private isFileQuery(query: string): boolean {
    // Very naive check: look for certain keywords or file references
    return /document|file|report|internal|our/i.test(query);
  }
  private isSearchQuery(query: string): boolean {
    // Naive check for needing web search (e.g., "latest", "current", or a question form)
    return /latest|current|today|http|www|search/i.test(query);
  }
}

// Example usage:
(async () => {
  const orchestrator = new Orchestrator();
  const userQuery = "What are the latest trends in electric vehicle adoption? Can you include any relevant stats from our 2023 report?";
  const answer = await orchestrator.handleQuery(userQuery);
  console.log("Final Answer:\n", answer);
})();
In the above orchestrator, we used simple regex-based heuristics (isFileQuery, isSearchQuery) to decide routing. In a real system, you might replace that with a call to a GPT-4 model that outputs an agent name to use, or use the Agents SDK’s handoff mechanism. Now, let’s see example implementations of the agents used:
typescript
Copy
Edit
// agents/ResearchAgent.ts
import OpenAI from 'openai';  // from the official SDK
import { Agent } from '../agent';

const client = new OpenAI({ apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY });

export class ResearchAgent implements Agent {
  name = 'ResearchAgent';

  async handleTask(userQuery: string): Promise<string> {
    // Call OpenAI Responses API with web search tool
    const response = await client.responses.create({
      model: 'gpt-4o',  // GPT-4 with operations (tools) support
      tools: ['web_search'],
      instructions: "You are an AI research assistant who can search the web for information and provide findings with sources.",
      input: userQuery
    });
    const result = response.output_text;
    console.log(`[ResearchAgent] Web search results for query "${userQuery}":\n${result}`);
    return result;
  }
}
The ResearchAgent above uses the openai SDK’s responses.create method to perform a web search. It specifies the model gpt-4o and enables the web_search tool, along with an instruction prompt to ensure the answer has sources. The returned output_text will typically include the information found plus citations​
COMMUNITY.OPENAI.COM
. We log it for debugging, then return it. Next, the ReportAgent:
typescript
Copy
Edit
// agents/ReportAgent.ts
import OpenAI from 'openai';
import { Agent } from '../agent';

const client = new OpenAI({ apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY });

export class ReportAgent implements Agent {
  name = 'ReportAgent';

  async handleTask(content: string): Promise<string> {
    // This agent just uses the model to compose a well-structured answer.
    // We assume 'content' includes either the user query or a prepared prompt with data.
    const response = await client.responses.create({
      model: 'gpt-4',  // using standard GPT-4 here (no external tools needed for writing)
      instructions: "You are a report-writing assistant. Produce a clear, structured answer in Markdown, and include citations for any facts.",
      input: content
    });
    const result = response.output_text;
    console.log(`[ReportAgent] Composed report for input "${content.slice(0,50)}...":\n${result}`);
    return result;
  }
}
Here the ReportAgent uses gpt-4 (the standard GPT-4 model via Responses API or could also use Chat Completions API similarly). We provide instructions to ensure the style and requirement of citations. The content passed in might be directly the user question (for simpler queries) or a synthesized prompt that includes research notes (as done in the Orchestrator). We log and return the formatted answer. Finally, the FileAgent:
typescript
Copy
Edit
// agents/FileAgent.ts
import OpenAI from 'openai';
import { Agent } from '../agent';

const client = new OpenAI({ apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY });

export class FileAgent implements Agent {
  name = 'FileAgent';

  async handleTask(userQuery: string): Promise<string> {
    // Use the file_search tool to find info in uploaded files
    const response = await client.responses.create({
      model: 'gpt-4o',
      tools: ['file_search'],
      instructions: "You are a file retrieval assistant with access to the organization's knowledge base. If relevant information is found in the files, present it with the source.",
      input: userQuery
    });
    const result = response.output_text;
    console.log(`[FileAgent] File search results for "${userQuery}":\n${result}`);
    return result;
  }
}
The FileAgent is similar to the ResearchAgent but uses tools: ['file_search']. The instructions clarify that it should use the internal knowledge base. The output might include text from files or a summary of what was found, with maybe identifiers of which document it came from (the model might say, e.g., "According to 2023_Annual_Report.pdf: ..."). We return that text. With these agents defined, the orchestrator’s handleQuery can coordinate them. In our Orchestrator.handleQuery code, if it detects the query needs file data, it calls FileAgent directly. If it needs web info, it calls ResearchAgent then feeds the result to ReportAgent. The final answer is then returned. Running the example: When we run the usage example with a query about “latest trends in electric vehicle adoption” including “stats from our 2023 report,” the orchestrator might do the following behind the scenes:
isFileQuery returns true (because it sees "our 2023 report"), so it calls FileAgent.handleTask.
The FileAgent, via the Responses API, searches the knowledge base (perhaps a file containing the 2023 report) and returns something like: "According to the 2023 Sales Report, electric vehicle adoption grew 25% last year in our company’s region.【file: 2023_report】"
The orchestrator didn’t implement combining file + web in this simple logic, so it might actually skip the ResearchAgent since isSearchQuery might also be true but we checked file first. In a more advanced logic, we could do both: first get file info, then also get web info, and then ask ReportAgent to merge them. That’s an iteration you can experiment with.
In this run, say we only did file. The orchestrator might then still pass everything to ReportAgent to ensure formatting. In our code, we didn’t explicitly do that in the if (isFileQuery) branch – we directly returned the fileAgent’s output. We could improve that by actually sending it to ReportAgent for better formatting if needed.
The final answer (from either FileAgent directly or after formatting) is printed out. It might look like a short report that says: "According to our 2023 report, EV adoption grew 25% last year. Additionally, external research shows global EV sales rose 40% in 2022​
COMMUNITY.OPENAI.COM
..." (if we had combined web info, for instance).
This example is simplistic but showcases the structure: each agent encapsulates a particular ability (web search, file search, writing), and the orchestrator delegates queries accordingly. In a real production implementation, you would refine the routing logic (potentially using an AI to decide or multiple passes), add more robust error handling around those API calls, and incorporate the Agents SDK once available in Node to simplify the orchestration logic (the SDK could replace the manual isFileQuery/isSearchQuery logic with an AI decision, and handle the chaining of calls through its Runner or similar mechanism). Nonetheless, the pattern remains: a high-level orchestrator coordinating specialized AI agents results in a powerful, extensible system. You can answer user queries that require a variety of AI skills (searching data, reasoning, writing) in a way that’s maintainable and scalable. By following this guide – structuring your project cleanly, using OpenAI’s Responses API for built-in tools, and leveraging the Agent SDK’s orchestration features – you’ll be well-equipped to build a production-ready AI agent system.
